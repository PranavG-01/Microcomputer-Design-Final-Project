Abstract

For the final project, a mesh alarm clock system which requires the user to snooze all nodes in the mesh system for the alarm to stop was created. This was done to stop people from sleeping through their alarm, and to force them to get out of bed to wake up. The alarm system is made up of one host device and one or more node devices. The alarm can be set through a web interface, which collects the time the alarm goes off. Once the information is submitted, an LCD screen on the host device will display the current time, whether the alarm is set or not, and the configured alarm time. Once the alarm triggers, the host device begins buzzing, and there are buttons on the host device and node devices that all need to be pressed in order for the devices to stop buzzing. This project was coded in Python and completed using two Raspberry Pi’s. The project was successfully completed without any major obstacles.
